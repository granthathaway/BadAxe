    <h1>The Story </h1>
	  <p> I Have always been fascinated with history. My parents raised me with a very deep appreciation of the people who came before us, and to respect and remember where you came from. My mother - one of the most intelligent people I know - spent uncountable time teaching me about history. </p>
    <p>I was also quite a gamer. Games like Total War, and Age of Empires really rang with me. And to top it all off, my wonderful mother jumped headfirst into some family history research and found that we are descendents of William the Conqueror, and Rollo, The Duke of Normandy. </p>
	  <p>This has been a big part of who I am and shaped a lot of my passions and views. This understanding of love and respect for your ancestors doubles over into my immediate family - My dad. I remember spending what seemed like YEARS standing next to my dad as he showed me how to work and fix things around the house. At the time, his creativity was lost on me, but now with sons of my own, I see the value of what he did. </p>
	  <p>I started to collect weapons of my own - mostly the fantastical, decorative ones that belong on a shelf. And every time I would get a new one of these cheap display pieces my dad would say, "That's really cool, but what would REALLY be cool is if you spent that money making one of your own!" </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>Well, its hard to jump into something new like that, especially with no experience. And I can say that my first attempts at making ANYTHING worthwhile was pretty laughable. But if there's one thing I learned from my dad, its not to quit. </p>
  </div><hr>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>Making weapons was put on hold for a long time. I grew up, got married, and had two amazing sons. These boys really changed my life - and made me appreciate all the things that my dad had tried to teach me. </p>
      <p>When my oldest son was 3 he called me into his room, saying he was "afraid of the monsters." We'll this was an opportunity to help him overcome his fears, and build that same pride in where he came from that my mother instilled in me. I looked him in the eye and said, "You should be glad for the monsters, they're hiding from you because THEY are scared of YOU. We are Vikings, and there's nothing we need to be afraid of."</p>
      <p>It seemed to work for him at the time, but I didnt realize til later how well it did. Over the next two years he reminded me that we are Vikings periodically. But one day like deja-vu I was called back in to his room, this time by my youngest. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p>He looked up at me and said the same thing, "Dad, I'm scared of the monsters." I knew exactly what I was going to say, but I never got the chance. From the top bunk, my oldest leans over and says to his brother, bursting with pride, "I'll protect you, Link. We NEVER have to be afraid! We are VIKINGS, and monsters are scared of US!" </p>
      <p>Neither of them have ever been scared at night since. That moment brought back a new appreciation for the pride I have, and want my sons to have in where we came from. This reminded me of the things my dad told me and made me want to start doing something that would encapsulate and symbolize this idea. </p>
      <p>So I got to work! </p>

	  <p>My first few axes took some work, but turned out decently. I wanted to never create something that would be a wall-prop. I wanted rugged, useable pieces that would look better when used and abused. I wanted REAL axes. I don't own a forge, so to accomplish this for now I repurpose actual axe heads. I figured out some methods to make the blades look more worn, and more characterized. I worked through a few different techniques to carve in runes and designs, to wrap handles effctively and aesthetically, to secure the heads to the haft for good, hard use. </p>
	  <p>All the axes now made are done to order - blade finishes, woodworking and finish, wrapping, runes, symbols, etc. Each one is meant to give the same sense of fearlessness and pride that my family has come to learn. Celebrate your inner badass with a BadAxe. </p>
